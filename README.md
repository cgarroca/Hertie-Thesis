This is the repository for the Masters thesis "Analyzing Political Promises: A Topic Modeling Approach to the Manifestos of Costa Rica's 2024 Local Government Elections as a Tool for Transparency". It contains all the data and code that is needed for doing the whole process from scratch to the results.

R programming was used for extracting the PDF content. While Python was used for preprocessing the data, and the data analysis and visualization.

This masters thesis used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract topics from political manifestos and compares them to indicators that diagnose the state of municipalities.
